## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to classify dog breeds using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow.  
The goal is to create an accurate and efficient system for recognizing different dog breeds from images.  
The dataset contains various breeds with varying image counts, so models are evaluated with a focus on **accuracy** and **confusion matrix analysis** to ensure robust performance.

---

## 2. Data Preprocessing
- All images were resized to **224√ó224√ó3** to ensure consistency for the model.  
- Images were processed in batches of **32** to optimize training efficiency.  
- The dataset was split into **80% training** and **20% validation** sets.  
- Labels were encoded appropriately for multiclass classification.

---

## 3. Model Architecture
The model was built using TensorFlow and consists of:

- Convolutional layers for feature extraction.  
- Pooling layers for dimensionality reduction.  
- Dense layers for classification.  
- Softmax activation in the output layer for multiclass probability prediction.

---

## 4. Model Training
- Optimizer: **Adam**  
- Loss function: **Categorical Crossentropy**  
- Metrics: **Accuracy**
- Epochs: 25‚Äì50 (depending on early stopping criteria)  
- Batch size: 32  
- Early stopping was applied to prevent overfitting.

## 5. Model Performance

| Metric       | Value   |
|--------------|---------|
| Accuracy     | 0.70    |
**Note:** Metrics are calculated using the validation set to evaluate generalization performance.
